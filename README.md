## Explanation on how this works

This works purely on the basis of GitHub Workflow Actions, So a VERY BIG THANKS to GitHub.
I've created the script where Actions will automatically trigger the workflow every day for 5:00 PM IST.

The tokens, GitHub Email, and ID are required because we are basically creating another repo and gists with this script using them
